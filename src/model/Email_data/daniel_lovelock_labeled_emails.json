Please plan to pick up your gear from Pacific Wilderness on Friday before 5:00pm to allow time for fitting your gear. Be sure you set-up and test all your gear, including testing your regulators and BCD, at the shop before putting it in your car and leaving. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR GEAR. Finding an issue at the dive site may prevent you from participating in these dives and result in you having to reschedule. As a reminder, you will have to upgrade to integrated weights rather than a weight belt and / or a computer rather than the standard set of gauges with depth and air pressure. Remember we opted to use the computers so we didn't have to take the recreational dive planer test. It is important to remember your personal gear (gloves, boots, snorkel, mask, fins), swimsuit, towel, change of clothes, water, snacks, and sunscreen. Don't forget, we need 2 copies of a passport sized photo so if you only submitted 1, bring them in for this weekend. Find local businesses, view maps and get driving directions in Google Maps. www.google.com Please try to park as close as possible to the top of the stairs. When you get to the beach set up all of your gear and stage all your personal gear so we can all be on the same page to gear up. Once you are all ready to go, we will meet up at the top of the stairs to go over what we are going to do. On Saturday, be ready for the dive briefing no later than 6:30am (Meet-up time). We'll aim to be in the water for 7:00am (Start-up time) for the first dive. Plan to bring your tanks back to Pacific Wilderness after the dive to refill your tanks. Or we can fill your tanks at the local dive shop on your dime as to save you the drive and probably be cheaper than the gasoline. If you feel you can't locate me, call me at (949)309-1290. Ill be in a Silver Volvo Let me know if you have any questions. Looking forward to diving with all of you! Sunday will most likely be the same beach at Veterans Park Josue Lopez #254617 (949)309-1290 PS. Jana, I'm just assuming you are going to be my Divemaster, If I'm wrong please disregard. Thanks, you are the best! Welcome to your Pacific Wilderness PADI Open-Water Diver Course!

Its a good idea to be parked in the shops back parking lot no later than 8:45 am. Please pull all the way forward if you are in one of the Tandem Parking spots. Finishing time depends on you and your classmates mastering the dive skills and your comprehension of the academic portion in the classroom. Either way, plan on being at the shop all day on both days (9 am to 5 pm). When you get to the shop, please park behind the store or on side streets (17th or 18th). The street out front (Pacific Avenue) is only 1-hour parking. The stores Parking Lot in back fits 16 cars, so if you arrive at about 8:30 am, you will likely be guaranteed a prime parking spot. This will make loading & unloading gear much easier  You will need to have reasonable swimming skills, so please be comfortable in the water. :) To demonstrate that you are comfortable in the water, we have two quick tests in the pool. The 1st test will be a 200-yard swim, non-stop, without aid, or 300 yards with mask, fins, and snorkel. There is NO TIME LIMIT, so dont worry, we just need to assess your skill level. 2nd test will be to float/tread water for 10 minutes without aid. If you do not know how to swim, please take a class at the YMCA prior to starting your class. This is a SCUBA class, not a SWIM Class . Please come to class prepared. Bring everything that came in the PADI Book package and please have all the academic portions done. This means to read your entire book, watch the video/DVD/USB Drive, and answer all the Knowledge Review questions. There are 5 Knowledge Reviews, one at the end of each chapter. Please make a copy of each one of these completed Knowledge Reviews and bring them with you to class. I will need the copies for your Student Record Folder (SRF). Also, please read & review the RDP  recreational Dive Planner Booklet and practice doing the tables. You will need to understand the Dive Tables as part of your training and final testing. During class, you will be taking 4 multiple choice quizzes and a final exam to finish the academic portion here at the shop. This will show that you understand Diving Concepts and Physics. So please be prepared. For the dive skills portion in the pool, you will need to complete 5 dives. Each of these dives has a set of skills prescribed, each one progressing on the last. Starting in the shallow end (3.5 ft.) & ending in the deep end (12 ft.). Weekend #2 (Ocean Dives) Friday: The day before your Local Beach Dives, youll need to come into our San Pedro Location to pick up your SCUBA Rental Gear (One Weekend of Rental Gear Included in the class). Plan on about 45 minutes for fitting, so please dont show up at 10 minutes till closing (which is 7 pm). If you cant make it Friday to pick up Rental Gear and wish to pick it up earlier, you will be charged a daily rate for the extra day(s). You may also arrange a pre-fitting Sunday during Class/Pool break and have another Student in your Class pick the gear up for you on Friday as scheduled. Youll need a Full Pack which includes Regulator System, Tank, BC, Weight Belt & Weights, Wetsuit & Hood. Youll also need to pack your Basic Snorkeling Gear for the Dives as well. Prep your Gear Friday night when you get home and prepare for some weekend Fun! You will be offered the option to upgrade your regulator System to include a computer. In which case you will not need to supply a dive watch for the dives. Should you choose the upgrade, its only $15 for the weekend & is completely OPTIONAL.

When you arrive at the Beach, youll find parking and have a stack of Quarters (about $10 worth) and/or a Credit Card with you to feed the meter. Following your two dives, youll make your way back to Pacific Wilderness for Air Re-Fills on your Tanks (Included in Class) in preparation for Sundays final two dives. You can then clean up if you wish and have the afternoon off to enjoy the rest of your day. Sunday: You'll get up Early to meet with fellow students and your Instructor(s) at the Local Beach Diving spot at 7 or 8 am again.

        "body": " How to write a cold email that sells social media management services Here's a cold email that targets decision-makers from tech B2B companies with between $1-5M in revenue.  Let's see what mistakes , the CEO of lead gen agency, recommends you avoid if you want more replies: Mistake #1: Fake referenceIf you actually didnt talk to the person youre mentioning, dont bring it up. This can lead to friction and put the leads' focus away from your value. Mistake #2: Repetitive personalizationThe company name is mentioned 3 times. Just because you are repeating a custom variable doesnt make your email feel more personal. Instead, introduce multiple variables about your lead to show you researched them properly.Mistake #3: Criticizes the readerPeople dont like to feel judged or criticized even when there is room for improvement. Instead, rephrase it to make it sound less negative. Mistake #4: Requires too much work for each lead Even though it's recommended, crafting a highly personalized experience for each lead might be too time-consuming. Instead, you can focus only on highly qualified ones and create in a few minutes. Heres how Estefa would rewrite this cold email and her tips for more replies: Tip #1: Add relevant insight with no big assumptionsAfter you figure out your niche audiences focus, bring insight in a natural tone without making any assumptions. You can ask a question to confirm their objective. Tip #2: Mention pain point they have overcomeBy focusing on the pain they overcame, you show your leads you understand their background well and know what youre talking about. Tip #3: Mention pain point they havent overcomeOnce you show you understand them, highlight something they havent achieved yet. This will make your solution seem more relevant. Tip #4: Social proof on how you solve the pain pointMention only the success of relevant companies and businesses your leads can relate to. This will help you position yourself as credible and trustworthy. P.S. Watch the full cold email teardown for even more tips on booking meetings . 2 ways to beat email sending limits& reach more prospects If you exceed your service providers email sending limit, you risk getting blocked or marked as spam. But if you limit yourself to 200 emails a day, youre slowing down your growth.Here's how to get around email sending limits and reach more potential buyers - without harming your email deliverability.  Option 1: Manually send the same campaign from multiple email accountsFor example, you can reach 200 leads per day with only one sending account. With 5 sender email addresses, that number increases to 1000 leads reached.Of course, you wont be able to use the same name for every account, but you could: add slight variations (e.g., JohnSmith@gmail.com, John.Smith@gmail.com, John_Smith@gmail.com) use different domain names (e.g., Tiana@lemlist.com, Tiana@lemlist.co, Tiana@lemlist.ai)  use your teams account names (e.g., Avi@GoodProduct.com, Hassan@GoodProduct.com, Joe@GoodProduct.com)However, this process is highly time-consuming as you'd have to: copy and paste each campaign into every individual account  segment & assign leads to different senders manually constantly switch back and forth between campaignsOption 2: Add multiple senders without manual efforts The best way to reach more potential customers (without worrying about email sending limits) is to use a cold outreach automation tool like . lemlist users can send the same campaign to as many potential customers as they want, .This will help you:  Send the same outreach campaign from multiple lemlist sending accounts Keep your messages personalized and targeted at scale Save time on duplicating campaigns and manually distributing leads Stop losing prospects to the manual back-and-forth between accounts Step 1: If you dont already have a lemlist account, you can create one . Step 2: Configure the email accounts youd like to useNote: 1 lemlist seat = 1 account = 1 sender! You can rotate as many sending accounts as the number of lemlist seats you signed up for. Step 3: Create or go to an existing campaignYou can use the power of to create fully customized multichannel sequences in seconds! Step 4: Use Inbox rotationWhen your campaign is ready, simply open the drop-down menu under Senders for the email steps and choose from which lemlist sending accounts youd like to send your campaign. The app will randomly assign senders to your prospects so that each sender is evenly distributed. If certain steps would be more effective when associated with specific senders, you can force select one account for any of the steps.Step 5: Track your results As your campaign continues, you can track its success metrics via the campaign reports page.Youll access an overview of the data for all senders, including open, reply, and interested rates for every campaign step. You can also review the metrics for each sender to track how well each account performed at each step and double down your success.

Even amongst larger tech companies, the traditional 1 year cliff has mostly been removed. And now, were starting to see interesting new variations in both the length and vesting amounts by year. Companies such as Mercury are trying a 6 year schedule to encourage a longer term mindset with equity. While others such as Stripe have been experimenting with a at a time.

With recent news of companies like LinkedIn and Stack Overflow , it might not seem like the market is picking back up, but were here to assure you that we're seeing some positive signs as well. In addition to seeing household names like Apple and Google hiring more engineers and product managers, our coaches have also seen companies again! As companies start building back up their hiring teams, we expect to see more movement in the future as well into next year. Something weve seen recently, and will continue to keep an eye on, is high hiring bars. Many clients coming to us have shared how much theyve been getting down-leveled by various companies during the interview process. Many of our senior/principal clients are taking roles a level lower than they were pre-layoffs. 2024 Internships  Internship applications for 2024 are in full swing now, so we wanted to highlight a few good internships weve seen recently.

Market Updates  With companies like hiring recruiters again, we expect others to follow suit to build up their recruiting teams ahead of the new year, signaling positive movement for the hiring market overall. From our perspective, the layoffs for the above mentioned companies seem to stem primarily from re-organization and adjustment, more-so than following the downward turn of the market. also signals good news for the market, with a strong acquisition of a popular product. That said, the biggest theme among what weve seen this month is a continued interest in AI and AI-drive products. Atlassian themselves said that they see the power of AI pushing the acquisition further with features like video transcripts, summaries, documents, and the workflows developed from them, providing multiple ways for teams to connect and collaborate. According to a of 400 US CEOs, 72% said that investment in generative AI is a top priority for their company. Remote work has also been a hot topic. Most companies seem to be settling around a minimum of 3 days in office with 2 flexible days for WFH. A recent LinkedIn report shared how nearly half of job seekers are seeking remote work. While not perfect, the new norm is better than pre-covid and companies that offer more flexibility will be able to attract a broader base of talent.

Cole Rachel After I visited Mexico City for the first time nearly 20 years ago, my foodie friend scolded me. Hed given me a long list of restaurants to visit, but I spent most of my time frequenting the taco stands outside my hotel. I knew there were lots of other things I should be eating, but the allure of these perfect little tacos mere steps away was too strong. Every subsequent visit to the city has followed a familiar pattern: There is never enough time to frequent all the places I already love while exploring all the new places I have yet to see. Mexico City is just too vast and too good, which explains why it remains a perennial favorite among our readers.

Account ending: 81006 Member since: 2023 Hello, Daniel Lovelock Daniel, with Plan It, you have the option to split purchases of $100 or more, like your next family vacation or new exercise equipment, into equal monthly payments with a fixed fee.* Plan It is built into your Card so you can still earn rewards on purchases the way you usually do! Three easy steps to use Plan It: Select a single purchase of $100 or more or combine up to 10 to put into a plan after your purchase is posted. Pick the plan that works for you. You'll have up to 3 plan durations to choose from with a fixed monthly fee. Review, confirm, and you'll know exactly how much you will pay. The monthly plan payment is automatically included in the minimum payment due each month.

The plan fee is a fixed finance charge that will be charged each month that the corresponding plan is active. You will be offered 1-3 plan duration options for the qualifying purchase. The plan duration options can vary based on a variety of factors such as the purchase amount, your Account history and your creditworthiness. If you are enrolled in an intro or promotional APR, you may see limited plan duration options during the intro or promotional period when you use Plan It on your Account. If you create a plan during an introductory or promotional APR period, your plan fee will be based on the introductory or promotional APR as long as the plan is created before 11:59pm MST on the last day of the introductory or promotional period. To create a plan, select qualifying purchases of $100 or more and a plan duration. If you have a Card with a Credit Limit, you may also be able to select a qualifying amount of $100 or more and a plan duration. When creating a plan for purchases, you may select up to 10 qualifying purchases for each plan that you create in your American Express online Account. However, you may select only one qualifying purchase for each plan that you create in the American Express App. Qualifying purchases will be identified in your American Express online Account and American Express App. Qualifying purchases (or a qualifying amount, if you have a Card with a Credit Limit) do not include purchases of cash or cash equivalents, balance transfers (if offered), purchases subject to Foreign Transaction Fees, or any fee owed to us, including Annual Membership fees. Unless you are creating a plan at checkout, please allow 2-3 days for your purchase to post to your Account. Once your purchase posts and is no longer pending, you can create a plan for that purchase. Your ability to create plans will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness, and your Credit Limit or Pay Over Time Limit, as applicable. The Pay Over Time Limit applies to the total of your Pay Over Time, Cash Advance, and Plan balances. You may not be able to create a plan if it would cause you to exceed your Pay Over Time Limit or cause your Plan balance to exceed 95% of your Account Total New Balance on your last billing statement. You will not be able to create plans if your Pay Over Time feature is suspended or your Account is canceled. You will also not be able to create plans if one or more of your American Express Accounts is enrolled in a payment program, has a payment that is returned unpaid, or is past due. The number and length of plan duration options offered to you, the number of active plans you can have at a time, and your ability to include multiple qualifying purchases in a single plan, will be at our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as your creditworthiness, the purchase amount(s), and your Account history. After a plan is paid in full, it will be removed from your Account in the next billing period. Plan It is available on Card Accounts issued by a U.S. banking subsidiary of American Express, excluding Accounts that do not have either a Credit Limit or the Pay Over Time feature. Only the Basic Card Member or Authorized Account Managers on the Account can create a plan. Prepaid Cards and products, American Express Corporate Cards, American Express Small Business Cards and American Express-branded Cards or Account numbers issued by other financial institutions are not eligible.

Information about earning/transferring Avios points to British Airways: Avios points earned during a billing cycle will be automatically transferred to British Airways after the end of each billing cycle. You must have a U.S. address listed on your British Airways Executive Club profile to earn Avios points in the British Airways card rewards program. Avios points expiration: Avios points will expire according to the British Airways Executive Club program terms and conditions which include maintaining Executive Club program activity for 36 consecutive months. Losing Avios points: Youll immediately lose all Avios points that havent been transferred to British Airways if your card account status changes, or your card account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. Rewards Categories: Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant wont qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category. For more information about Chase rewards categories, see chase.com/RewardsCategoryFAQs.

EXECUTIVE CLUB PROGRAMME You must be a member of the British Airways Executive Club programme. If you are not already a Member, you will be enrolled automatically if you are approved for the British Airways Visa. Avios accumulated through the British Airways Visa card will be transferred to your Executive Club account; however, Avios reported on your monthly statement from Chase may not post into your Executive Club account if you change your Executive Club address to one outside of the US. Avios earned with the British Airways Visa card will not be credited toward Executive Club tier level progression or retention. For rules and regulations of the Executive Club, please visit ba.com. Redemption of Avios for travel is solely the responsibility of British Airways.

Were excited to roll out an improved and intuitive scheduling experience that inspires customer confidence and productivity. How should I share my scheduling link in a polite way? is a question I often received about two years ago.Fortunately, many of you shared and .In short, you suggested opening the door for others first by allowing the recipient to offer their availability  before you offer yours. For example, Calendly users can politely say:Feel free to share some dates/times, or you can choose from my Calendly here.Now, a new scheduling-etiquette question has emerged that the armchair sociologist in me loves:Doesnt how I share my link depend on my role? If Im trying to sell something, then dont I need to be more polite than if Im buying?\"So, heres a scheduling-etiquette revision for those more nuanced situations:If youre doing the asking  e.g., youre a salesperson asking for a meeting, a startup founder asking for funding, etc.  youll probably get better results if you ask for the recipients time first. Feel free to share some dates/times, or you can choose from my Calendly here.If theyre doing the asking  e.g., you can authorize a purchase, youre a startup investor, or they want to pick your brain  you can probably get away with a brief Heres my Calendly.Now, Im one of those drivers at a four-way stop who says No, you go, so personally I think you should open the doors for others first regardless of your power position.

Cole Rachel I am fortunate that I have a partner who loves to cook. This has made my life infinitely better. Not only do I get to eat the things he makes, but his love of kitchen gadgetry makes him incredibly easy to shop for. The only downside to our situation is that my own cooking skills have become sadly lacking over the past few years as a result. However, while taking a cooking class on a recent Oceania cruise  as I poached a beautiful piece of fish in a room full of strangers  I had the shocking realization that maybe I actually like cooking. And even more shockingly, maybe I could actually be good at it? Time will tell, of course, but this midcruise epiphany has inspired me not only to reconsider our kitchen ephemera, but also to think long and hard about food.

Eligibility and Overview: You may participate in this Program as a referrer until the Program is terminated or modified by Venmo. If you refer a referee prior to Venmos termination or modification of the program, you and such referees will still be eligible to earn the reward described below even if the referee does not fulfill the Reward Criteria (defined below) before such termination or modification. To be eligible to earn rewards through the Program, each referrer and referee must have (or sign up for, in the case of referees) a Venmo account in good standing (Valid Account) at the time of participation through when his/her reward(s) are issued. A referrer may refer a referee by sending them an email, text, or social post that includes a link to participate in the Program, as provided by Venmo (Invitation). Each referee must complete all the following steps (Reward Criteria) within fourteen (14) days of the date on which the referrers referral link was created (end of day is based on Pacific Time): Sign up for a Valid Account for the first time via the link sent by the referrer.

Reward: For a limited time, for referrals successfully completed after August 15, 2022 and by December 31, 2022 at 11:59:59 p.m. the reward will be $10 USD sent to a Valid Account within approximately twenty-four (24) hours but may take up to two (2) weeks.

California CST#1022318; Washington UBI#600-469-694 $120 Uber Cash Basic Card Members on a Consumer U.S. American Express Gold Card are eligible for $10 in Uber Cash each month (\"Amex Benefit\"), subject to these Terms and Conditions. To receive this benefit, you must have downloaded the latest version of the Uber App and your eligible American Express Gold Card must be a method of payment in your Uber account. The Amex Benefit may only be used in the United States. To be eligible for the Amex Benefit, your Card Account must not be canceled or past due. American Express reserves the right to suspend your eligibility for the Amex Benefit if we suspect any violation or abuse. To continue to receive the Amex Benefit, the details for your eligible Card must be kept up to date in your Uber Account. Cards added to your Uber account through a third party such as Apple Pay or PayPal will not be eligible. An eligible American Express Gold Card may receive the Amex Benefit on one Uber account. If the same Card is added to multiple Uber accounts, only the first Uber account to which the Card is added will receive the Amex Benefit. If your American Express Card details change, you will need to make required updates to your Card details in your Uber payment profile before the end of the current month to ensure you remain enrolled in the Amex Benefit. If you do not update your Card details prior to the first day of the following month, you may need to re-enroll to continue to receive your Amex benefit. It may take up to 48 hours for the Amex Benefit to become available in your Uber account after your eligible Card has been added to that account. The Amex Benefit is found within your Uber Cash balance. In order to use the Amex Benefit, Uber Cash must be turned on. If Uber Cash is turned on when you request a ride, Uber Cash will appear above the confirmation button. If Uber Cash does not appear above the confirmation button, tap on the current payment option and turn on Uber Cash. If you do not see the Amex Benefit in your Uber Cash balance within 48 hours from the time you enroll, call the number on the back of your Card for assistance. The Amex Benefit may be applied to all vehicle types with Uber, orders on Uber Eats and to any other services to which Uber permits Uber Cash to be applied. If your Uber Cash balance does not satisfy the cost of your ride or order, the primary payment method on your Uber account will be charged for the difference. The Amex Benefit will not apply to previous Uber transactions and cannot be used when paying with an UberFAMILY profile. New and existing Uber users are eligible. Uber will apply the Amex Benefit at the point of sale and it will be displayed on your emailed receipt. There is no limit to the number of transactions you may apply your Amex Benefit to each month, up to a total of $10 per month. Your monthly Amex Benefit expires at 11:59 PM Hawaii Standard Time on the last day of each calendar month. Unused balance in Uber Cash from your Amex Benefit will not carry over to the following month. Your Amex Benefit will be applied for the month in which the transaction is completed. If a transaction is eligible for another promotion that you have added to your Uber account, the promotion will be applied before your Amex Benefit. Certain other types of balances in Uber Cash may be applied to the cost of your ride or order prior to your Amex Benefit in Uber Cash. For purposes of fulfilling this benefit, American Express will share with Uber certain information about your Card, including the Card type, and updated Card information from time to time. If you do not wish to receive the Amex Benefit, please call the number on the back of your Card. If you do not see the Amex Benefit in your Uber Cash balance by 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time on the first day of each calendar month, call the number on the back of your Card for assistance.

See for the Membership Rewards program terms and conditions.

Reaching out because it's been too long, and because we are close (well 5 months away) from achieving one of our long term goals, which is a family trip to New York in the Spring time. In addition to a Broadway show (Chicago), loads of pizza and hopefully some culture, in the form of a museum or two, we were hoping we could catch up for a coffee / beer / wine / cocktail. It's not until the 30/31 March, so you still have plenty of time to plan a reason to be out of town, but it would be really lovely to see you, as it has been over 10 years (I think).The kids are all growing up fast (as they do). Sophie is a junior in high school, Alex is studying biology down in Santa Barbara (although she's currently doing a quarter abroad in Edinburgh), and Daniel is graduating in Comp Sci this December. He was actually hoping he might be able to chat with one/both of you about Software engineering work in the finance world. He did an internship with a local SW company in the Bay Area, but the world of banking is a bit of a mystery to him (albeit an enticing one). I left HID a little over a year ago and joined AWS, and Chris works at Workday. No short of stimulating conversation round the Lovelock family dinner table, I can tell you.Would love to hear from you and know you are well. Hopefully we might be able to catch up in March.Love Julian & Chris ",
